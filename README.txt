these lines show a simple simulation of projectile motion experiment.

The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether the time of a ball launched horizontally off
varies as the initial velocity is varied and the movement of the ball
from start point till it reachs destination under the action of gravity only.

there are two main important factors :
1- velocity => the initial speed of the ball.
2- angle => determine the variation of horizontal range when the ball is thrown

the idea is calculating (x,y) coorinates by time increasing, then
drawing a sequential circles to show the movement of ball at each point using Html5 Canvas.
